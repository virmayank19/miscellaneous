Reducing vulnerabilities 

Description:
This initiative aims to achieve the following:

Review all project dependencies.
Simplify maintenance and future updates by removing unnecessary dependencies.
Upgrade vulnerable libraries to mitigate potential security risks and performance issues.

Outcome:

Identified and reviewed all existing project dependencies

Removed/upgraded 8-9 vulnerable dependencies to their most recent and secure versions.

One particular dependency, birt-runtime, presented a unique challenge due to its unavailability on Maven Central. To overcome this obstacle, I took the initiative to create a custom project and automate the process of making birt a Maven dependency.Created a dedicated project and automated solution to make a birt-runtime project from BIRT SDK. 
The automated process will make future upgrades easy and straightforward for the BIRT Runtime.
