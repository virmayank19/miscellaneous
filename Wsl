1. Receive the natural language query
2. Parse the query into the following fields:
	"chart type": (to be filled with the extracted chart type)
	"field name": (to be filled with the extracted field name)
	"aggregation applied": (to be filled with the extracted aggregation)
	"filter criteria": (a JSON object to be filled with any extracted filter criteria).
3. Validate the extracted information:
	Ensure the chart type is valid (Single Value or another supported type).
	Ensure the aggregation applied is one of the allowed values.
4. Construct the JSON object based on the extracted information:
	If chart type is "Single Value":
		Create a JSON object with keys:
			"chart type": "Single Value"
			"field name": (the field to be visualized)
			"aggregation applied": (the aggregation to be applied)
			"filter criteria": (a JSON object containing any filter criteria)
	If chart type is not "Single Value":
		Create a JSON object with keys:
			"chart type": (the specified chart type)
			"x axis": (the field for the x-axis)
			"y axis": (a JSON object containing the field for the y-axis and the aggregation to be applied)
			"filter criteria": (a JSON object containing any filter criteria)
5. Output the constructed JSON object.
6. If unable to create the JSON object due to invalid or incomplete information, output "Can't perform computation on the query".
