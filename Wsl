1. Receive the natural language query
2. Parse the query into the following fields:
	"chart type": (to be filled with the extracted chart type)
	"field name": (to be filled with the extracted field name)
	"aggregation applied": (to be filled with the extracted aggregation)
	"filter criteria": (a JSON object to be filled with any extracted filter criteria).
3. Validate the extracted information:
	Ensure the chart type is valid (Single Value or another supported type).
	Ensure the aggregation applied is one of the allowed values.
4. Construct the JSON object based on the extracted information:
	If chart type is "Single Value":
		Create a JSON object with keys:
			"chart type": "Single Value"
			"field name": (the field to be visualized)
			"aggregation applied": (the aggregation to be applied)
			"filter criteria": (a JSON object containing any filter criteria)
	If chart type is not "Single Value":
		Create a JSON object with keys:
			"chart type": (the specified chart type)
			"x axis": (the field for the x-axis)
			"y axis": (a JSON object containing the field for the y-axis and the aggregation to be applied)
			"filter criteria": (a JSON object containing any filter criteria)
5. Output the constructed JSON object.
6. If unable to create the JSON object due to invalid or incomplete information, output "Can't perform computation on the query".





Step 1: Parse the natural language query.
Step 2: Check the value of the "chart type" field in the query.
Step 3: If chart type is equal to "Single Value", create the JSON object as follows:
	{
  	"chart type": "Single Value",
 	 "field name": <value from the field name in the query>,
 	 "aggregation applied": <value from the aggregation applied in the query>,
  	"filter criteria": {
    	"field_name": <value from filter criteria field_name in the query>,
    	"operator": <value from filter criteria operator in the query>,
    	"value": <value from filter criteria value in the query>
 	 }
	}

Step 4: If chart type is not equal to "Single Value", create the JSON object as follows:
	{
  	"chart type": <value from chart type in the query>,
  	"x axis": <value from x axis in the query>,
  	"y axis": {
    		"field name": <value from y axis field name in the query>,
    		"aggregation applied": <value from y axis aggregation applied in the query>
  	},
  	"filter criteria": {
    		"field name": <value from filter criteria field name in the query>,
    		"operator": <value from filter criteria operator in the query>,
    		"value": <value from filter criteria value in the query>
  	}
	}
Step 5: Ensure that aggregation applied values are from (average, count, sum, unique, min, max).
Step 6: If any required field is missing or has an invalid value, output "Can't perform computation on the query".







1. You will be givena Natual language query
2. Process Natural Language Query:
	Analyze the query to determine:
	
	Chart type (Single Value or other)
	Field name(s)
	Aggregation applied (average, count, sum, unique, min, max)
	Filter criteria (field name, operator, value)
3. Transform Query to JSON:

	If chart type is "Single Value":
	JSON
		{
			"chart type": "Single Value",
			"field name": "field_name",
			"aggregation applied": "aggregation_applied",
			"filter criteria": {
				"field_name": "field_name",
				"operator": "operator",
				"value": "value"
			}
		}

	If chart type is not "Single Value":
	JSON
		{
			"chart type": "chart_type",
			"x axis": {
				"field name": "field_name"
			},
			"y axis": {
				"field name": "field_name",
				"aggregation applied": "aggregation_applied"
			},
			"filter criteria": {
				"field name": "field_name",
				"operator": "operator",
				"value": "value"
			}
		}

4. Handle Errors:
	If unable to convert the query, output:
	JSON
	"Can't perform computation on the query"

5. Fields Description:
	sourceName: Name of the source system
	l8n: Trading location of the source system
	dayCash: Cash received or paid on the day
	currency: Currency of the amounts
	seliCcy: Currency of "sell" amounts of reverse positions
	buyCcy: Currency of "buy" amounts of reverse positions
	dayCashAdjustment: Adjustment applied to Day Cash
6. Output:
	Provide only the output JSON object, without extra information.
