Subject: Reviving Classic Fun Games on Fridays!

Dear [Team Members],

We've got some exciting news to share! Starting from today, we are reviving a classic tradition within our team - Friday fun and games. Every sprint on Friday, from 4 to 5 PM, we'll be setting aside some time for team bonding and laughter.

To kick things off, we've decided to reintroduce an old favorite: Scribble! It's a fantastic way to unwind, tap into your creativity, and have a blast with your colleagues. From the next session onwards, we'll also explore other entertaining games to keep the fun going.

We believe that these Friday game sessions will not only add a new dimension to our workweek but also help us strengthen our team spirit and collaboration. So, mark your calendars, clear your schedules, and be prepared for a dose of fun and friendly competition.

Join us this Friday at 4 PM in [location/virtual platform], and let's make our Friday afternoons more enjoyable!

We can't wait to see you there and share some laughs as we dive into the world of Scribble!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
