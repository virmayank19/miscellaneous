Title: Development of AI-Powered Resume Filtering Prototype
Description: Initiated and led the development of an AI-based resume filtering prototype as a side project, aiming to streamline and enhance the recruitment process. The solution leveraged a large language model (LLM) to score resumes against specific job descriptions using a dynamic, granular scoring system to reduce hallucination and improve consistency. Built a front-end interface to display structured candidate data (e.g., work history, education), and presented the prototype to senior leadership for feedback and potential adoption.
Outcome: Received strong interest and positive feedback from senior management on the innovation and potential impact. However, project implementation was paused due to compliance concerns related to EU GDPR and legal review requirements.





Title: Development of AI-Powered Contract Analysis System
Description: Designed and developed an AI-driven contract analysis system to address the challenges posed by the lack of standardized contract structures within the company. Using large language models (LLM), the system allows users to upload contract documents (PDFs/DOCs) and interact with them via a chat interface. It automatically extracts key contract fields such as start date, end date, and annual contract value, and allows for customizable field extraction. This tool aims to reduce manual review efforts and streamline contract management.
Outcome: Successfully delivered a fully functional prototype that improves efficiency in contract analysis and information extraction. While the system received positive feedback for its potential, its deployment was put on hold due to shifting business priorities.
