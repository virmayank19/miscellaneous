I have a business analytics software to make charts tables etc. You make a proposal to give to my manager. We want to generate a functionality to give insights on a chart similar to what power bi , zoho analytics,  tableau in the market shows. In the insights talk about different types of insights that we will show per chart type do not include which need some model to be trained but only those which can be achieved by statistical analysis , maths or classical machine learning. In insights sub topics of insights type like incling decling trend
Proposal: Adding Automated Insights to Charts and Tables
Introduction:

This proposal outlines the development of a new functionality within our business analytics software that automatically generates insights from charts and tables. This feature will enhance user experience and increase the value proposition of our software by providing data-driven insights without requiring extensive analytical expertise.

Inspiration:

The functionality is inspired by leading BI tools like Power BI, Zoho Analytics, and Tableau, which offer similar features. This addition will bring our software closer to industry standards and cater to the growing demand for user-friendly data exploration.

Proposed Functionality:

The new functionality will automatically generate insights based on the type of chart or table presented. These insights will be derived solely from statistical analysis, mathematical calculations, and classical machine learning, avoiding the need for separately trained models.

Types of Insights:

Here are some examples of insights that can be generated for different chart types:

Bar Charts:

Trending: Identify if the data is increasing, decreasing, or flat over time.
Comparison: Highlight significant differences between categories (e.g., highest and lowest values).
Distribution: Analyze the spread of data points (e.g., skewness, outliers).
Line Charts:

Trend Analysis: Confirm and quantify trends (e.g., linear regression, exponential growth).
Seasonality: Detect seasonal patterns in the data.
Cycle Analysis: Identify cyclical patterns and their duration (if applicable).
Pie Charts:

Composition: Indicate the percentage share of each category to the whole.
Dominant Category: Identify the category with the largest share.
Comparison: Highlight significant differences in percentage share between categories.
Table:

Statistical Summary: Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and range.
Correlation Analysis: Identify potential relationships between numerical variables.
Outlier Detection: Flag data points significantly different from the overall distribution.
Benefits:

Improved User Experience: Users can gain immediate data insights without needing advanced statistical knowledge.
Enhanced Decision Making: Data-driven insights support informed and confident decision-making.
Increased Efficiency: Saves time and effort by automating the initial analysis process.
Competitive Advantage: Positions our software with functionalities offered by leading industry solutions.
Next Steps:

Conduct further research and exploration of potential algorithms to generate insights for different chart types and tables.
Design and develop user interface elements to present insights within the software.
Conduct internal testing and user testing to validate the effectiveness and usability of the new feature.
By implementing this functionality, we can empower our users to unlock the full potential of their data and gain valuable insights with greater ease, enhancing the value and competitiveness of our business analytics software.

Automated Insights for Charts and Tables: A Detailed Look
This document details how our business analytics software can automatically generate insights from various chart and table types. These insights will be derived solely from statistical analysis, mathematical calculations, and classical machine learning, eliminating the need for separate model training.

Insights by Chart Type:

Bar Charts:

Trending: Identify if the data is increasing, decreasing, or flat over time (linear regression, moving averages).
Comparison: Highlight significant differences between categories (highest/lowest values, percentage difference).
Distribution: Analyze the spread of data points (skewness, outliers, standard deviation).
Average Analysis: Calculate and compare averages across categories (mean, median, range).
Line Charts:

Trend Analysis: Confirm and quantify trends (linear regression, exponential growth, polynomial models).
Seasonality: Detect and measure seasonal patterns (seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation).
Cycle Analysis: Identify cyclical patterns and their duration (spectral analysis).
Variance Analysis: Calculate and present variance metrics (standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation) to understand data dispersion.
Pie Charts:

Composition: Indicate the percentage share of each category to the whole.
Dominant Category: Identify the category with the largest share.
Comparison: Highlight significant differences in percentage share between categories (percentage point difference).
Pareto Analysis (80/20 rule): Identify the categories contributing to the majority (80%) of the total value based on their cumulative percentage.
Tables:

Statistical Summary: Calculate basic statistics for numerical variables (mean, median, standard deviation, range, minimum, maximum).
Correlation Analysis: Identify potential relationships between numerical variables (Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman rank correlation).
Outlier Detection: Flag data points significantly different from the overall distribution (z-scores, interquartile range).
Area Charts:

Trend Analysis: Analyze trends over time by considering the area under the curve (trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule).
Total Magnitude: Calculate and display the total magnitude represented by the entire area under the curve.
Comparison: Compare the overall magnitude between different areas on the same chart.
This approach provides users with a deeper understanding of their data without requiring advanced analytical expertise. By automating these initial insights, users can make informed decisions faster and focus on more complex analytical tasks.
