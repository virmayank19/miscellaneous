The Monthly Statement Conundrum:

Imagine you're a financial wizard, juggling millions of bank accounts. Every month, each account needs a personalized statement emailed to the customer. Manually generating and sending these statements would be a bureaucratic nightmare, right? You'd drown in a sea of paperwork, prone to errors and delays.

Step 1: Standardize with Report Definitions:

But fear not! Think of your trusty monthly statement template. It defines the layout, information, and overall structure. Our report definitions work similarly, acting as pre-designed blueprints for each report type. Just like your statement has sections for account details, transactions, and balances, you can design report definitions with specific data points and formatting for different needs, like account summaries or investment performance reports. This ensures consistency and saves you from reinventing the wheel each time.

Step 2: Automate with Schedules:

Remember the convenience of your statement magically arriving each month? Schedules replicate this magic. Set them up once, and reports are generated and delivered on autopilot, daily, weekly, or monthly - just like clockwork. Imagine sending thousands of personalized statements with a single click. Schedules free you from manual tasks and ensure timely delivery.

Step 3: Personalize at Scale with Parameterized Schedules:

But with millions of customers, individual schedules wouldn't scale. What if you could tell the system, "For every customer in this database, generate a statement with their name, account number, and email"? Enter parameterized schedules, your secret weapon for mass personalization. They leverage external data sources, like a simple CSV file or database query, to automatically insert specific customer details into each report. It's like having a million mini-schedules, each delivering a unique statement, all set up in one go!

Step 4: Organize with Report Groups:

Now imagine managing thousands of report definitions. Wouldn't it be chaotic? Just like organizing files in folders, our system uses report groups to categorize your definitions. Think of having separate groups for "monthly statements," "transaction summaries," and "tax reports." This keeps things organized and makes finding the right definition a breeze.

Step 5: Define the Finishing Touches with Output:

Before sending your reports, you need to decide where they land and how they look. Think of choosing a file name and format like PDF or Excel. Our system lets you define these output details within your report definition. Imagine automatically emailing PDFs with customized filenames to each customer - no more manual file attachments or formatting hassles.
