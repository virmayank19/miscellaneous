 Prompting Techniques: Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, and Dynamic Few-Shot
	Zero-Shot Prompting:
		Definition: Providing the LLM with a prompt without any examples.
		Example: "Write a poem about a robot who dreams of becoming a chef."
	One-Shot Prompting:
		Definition: Providing the LLM with a single example of the desired task.
		Example: "Translate the sentence 'Hello, how are you?' into French."
	Few-Shot Prompting:
		Definition: Providing the LLM with a few examples of the desired task.
		Example: "Translate the following sentences into French: 1. I like pizza. 2. She is a doctor. 3. What is your name?"
	Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting:
		Definition: Selecting and adjusting the few-shot examples based on the specific prompt or task.
		Example: For a prompt about a specific historical event, the LLM might retrieve and use relevant historical documents as few-shot examples.

What is CoT?
Definition: Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages LLMs to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
How it Works:
The prompt explicitly asks the model to "think step-by-step" or provide a "reasoning process."
This helps the model generate more coherent and accurate responses by guiding its thought process.
Benefits of CoT:
Improved Accuracy: CoT can lead to more accurate and informative responses, especially for complex or unfamiliar tasks.
Explainability: The step-by-step reasoning process can make the model's output more transparent and understandable.
Generalizability: CoT can help LLMs generalize their knowledge to new tasks and situations.

AI Techniques: Few-Shot Prompting
What is Few-Shot Prompting?
Definition: Few-shot prompting involves providing the LLM with a few examples of the desired task before giving it a new prompt.
How it Works:
The examples serve as a guide for the model, helping it understand the task and the expected output format.
The model can then apply this knowledge to new, unseen examples.
Advantages of Few-Shot Prompting:
Efficiency: It allows LLMs to perform tasks with minimal training data.
Flexibility: It can be adapted to a variety of tasks and domains.
Human-like Learning: Few-shot prompting mimics how humans learn from limited examples.


 AI Techniques: Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting
What is Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting?
Definition: Unlike static few-shot prompting, dynamic few-shot prompting allows the LLM to dynamically select and adjust the few-shot examples based on the specific prompt or task.
How it Works:
The model may use techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to find relevant examples from a large knowledge base.
The selected examples can be weighted or prioritized based on their relevance to the current prompt.
Benefits of Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting:
Adaptability: It enables the LLM to better adapt to a wider range of tasks and prompts.
Efficiency: By selecting only the most relevant examples, it can improve the model's efficiency.
Improved Performance: Dynamic few-shot prompting can lead to higher-quality outputs, especially for complex or domain-specific tasks.


 AI Techniques: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
What is RAG?
Definition: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation.
How it Works:
The LLM first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or database.
This retrieved information is then used to augment the LLM's response, providing more accurate and informative outputs.
Benefits of RAG:
Fact-Based Responses: RAG helps LLMs generate responses that are grounded in factual information.
Improved Accuracy: By incorporating relevant knowledge, RAG can improve the accuracy and quality of the LLM's outputs.
Efficiency: RAG can reduce the LLM's reliance on in-context learning, making it more efficient for certain tasks.



AI Techniques: Vector Search
What is Vector Search?
Definition: Vector search is a technique used to find items similar to a given query based on their semantic meaning or content.
How it Works:
Data is represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a different aspect of the data.
Similarity between items is measured by the distance between their vectors.
Vector search algorithms find items that are closest to the query vector in the vector space.
Applications in LLM Systems:
Document Retrieval: Finding relevant documents or information from a large corpus of text.
Question Answering: Finding answers to questions from text-based sources.
Translation: Finding the best translation for a given word or phrase.
Example:
A user asks an LLM to find an article about climate change.
The LLM uses vector search to find articles that are semantically similar to the query, such as articles about global warming, environmental sustainability, or climate action.
Slide 7: AI Techniques: Guardrails and Safety
Why are Guardrails Necessary?
Bias: AI models can inherit biases from the data they are trained on.
Misuse: LLMs can be used to generate harmful or misleading content.
Unintended Behavior: LLMs may produce unexpected or harmful outputs due to their complexity.
Self-Check Mechanisms:
Model Monitoring: Monitoring the model's performance in real-time to detect and mitigate harmful outputs.
Red Teaming: Employing adversarial techniques to challenge the model's assumptions and identify vulnerabilities.

Other Tools: There are many other tools and techniques available to help developers build safer and more responsible AI systems.

Slide 8: AI Techniques: Ethical Considerations
Bias in AI Models:
Algorithmic Bias: AI models can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in the data they are trained on.
Unintended Bias: Models may exhibit unintended biases that are not present in the training data.
Responsible AI Development and Deployment:
Diversity and Inclusion: Ensuring that AI development teams are diverse and inclusive.
Transparency and Explainability: Making AI models more transparent and understandable.
Accountability: Holding AI developers and deployers accountable for the impact of their models.
