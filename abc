1. Reporting Explained: A Peek into Your Monthly Bank Statement

Imagine your monthly bank statement as a report. It's a summary that showcases your financial transactions in an organized manner. In the same way, our reporting application generates summaries of data, transforming complex information into easy-to-understand reports.

Real-world example: Your bank statement includes details like deposits, withdrawals, and balances. Similarly, our reports could detail sales figures, employee performance, or any other relevant data for your business.

2. Scheduling Reports: Your Personal Assistant for Data

Just as you eagerly await your monthly bank statement, our reporting application allows you to schedule when your reports are generated and distributed. This is like having a personal assistant that ensures your reports are ready when you need them.

Real-world example: You might set up your bank to automatically send your statement on the first day of each month. Similarly, you can schedule our reporting application to send sales reports every Friday at 5 PM.

3. Auditing: Ensuring the Trustworthiness of Your Reports

When it comes to your bank statement, you trust that the numbers are accurate and unchanged. In our reporting application, we take auditing seriously. Any modifications to report definitions or schedules are carefully tracked and recorded to maintain the integrity of your data.

Real-world example: If someone were to alter your bank statement, you'd want to know about it. Similarly, our system alerts you if there are any changes to report definitions or schedules, ensuring transparency and trust in your data.

4. History and Executions: Keeping Track of Your Data Journey

Much like your bank statement history, our reporting application maintains a record of all scheduled executions. This means you can look back and see when reports were generated, what data they contained, and which reports were distributed during each execution.

Real-world example: Just as your bank statement history helps you track your financial journey, our system's history feature allows you to trace the evolution of your data over time.



Report: It's the information package tailored to your needs. Imagine it as a customized dashboard presenting specific data, like sales figures for a region or website traffic breakdown.
Schedule: It's the timer for your reports. Just like setting up automatic email replies, you can schedule reports to be sent automatically at regular intervals, daily, weekly, or even monthly.
Definition: This blueprint details what information goes into your report. Think of it as the recipe for your data dish, specifying which ingredients (data points) to include and how to prepare them (calculations, formatting).
Execution: It's when your scheduled report comes to life! The application gathers the data based on the definition, generates the report, and delivers it as per your instructions.
History: This logbook keeps track of past report executions. Imagine it as a record of past deliveries, showing when each report was sent and to whom.


Auditing: We understand that changes to report definitions or schedules can be critical. That's why we keep a detailed audit log. This log records who made what change, when, and why. It's like a movie with every editing step documented, ensuring accountability and traceability.
Execution History: Every time a scheduled report runs, the application meticulously records the details. This history log shows precisely which reports were delivered, when, and to whom. It's like a detailed delivery log, providing clarity and confidence.
