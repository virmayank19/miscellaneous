Imagine a clock ticking down to report time. Our trusty Report Server wakes up, just like a conductor raising a baton. It grabs all the reports scheduled for that time, like gathering sheet music for an orchestra. But these reports come in different formats, like violin or trumpet parts. So, the Server sends each report to a special expert called a Report Engine. Each Engine understands its format perfectly, like a skilled musician, and transforms the data into a beautiful report. Finally, the finished reports are delivered to the right people, sharing valuable information like the final notes of a song. This teamwork between the Server and Engines makes reporting efficient, flexible, and ready for anything!
