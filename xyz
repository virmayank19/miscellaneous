# Filtering Schedules

You can filter the schedules based on two criteria: report name and output file name.

**Filtering by Report Name**

1. Click on the "Report Name" drop-down menu.
2. Select the report definition you want to filter on.
3. Click "OK".

The list of schedules will be refreshed, and only schedules that use the selected report definition will be displayed.

**Filtering by Output File Name**

1. The "Output File" list displays all the output file names that are produced by executing reports in the system.
2. Select the output file(s) you want to filter on.

The schedules list view will be refreshed, and only schedules that contain report definitions that produce reports with the selected output file name will be displayed.
